Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React.

Let's build [this landing page](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-landing-page-with-react/blob/master/preview.gif) using React Function Components.

The idea is to split Bootstrap components into different function Components, they'll be all imported into the main component Home.jsx

***Please use Function Components for this***

Note: the Cards have different content, think DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and declare only ***one*** component and use ```props``` to handle different content.

## 🌱  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello
```

**👉 Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

💡 Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## Strategy

Take a few minutes to analyze 🤯 the image and draw your strategy on it, mark the components that you are going to develop:

![Strategy for building a landing page with react](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-landing-page-with-react/blob/master/strategy.gif?raw=true)

The key of this project is to help you understand how to pick the components that you want to build, you have to think the best way to organize and avoid future errors. What can be re-used? If your code is tuning into something big and hard to understand you probably will need to split it into components: `<Jumbotron />`, `<Navbar />`, `<Card />`.

That is it! Start coding your first React website.
Have fun!🎊
